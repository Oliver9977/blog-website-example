                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <a href="#">printing and typesetting industry</a>. Lorem
                    Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
                    ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                    specimen book.It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

                    <p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <b>Letraset sheets</b> containing Lorem Ipsum
                        passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                        versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                </div>

                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                    Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
                    more obscure Latin words,consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                </p>

                <h1> Why do we use it? </h1>
                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution of letters,as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                    default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                    infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like).

                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                    born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
                    great explorer of the truth,the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
                    avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,but because those who do not know how to pursue
                    pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
